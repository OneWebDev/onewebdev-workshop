To run any part, download the repository onto your local machine. If you are familiar with git, you can also clone the repository using a command line.

To run v1 and v2, simply open the html file into Google Chrome. This is all the setup needed.

To run v3, nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed. After installing nodejs open a command prompt at the same directory as the folder and the run the following commands:
1. npm i
2. node app.js (Note: If you plan on editing/expanding the server, consider install nodemon)
